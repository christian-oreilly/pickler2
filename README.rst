Pickler2
===================================

Small package allowing to decorate a function so that it automatically pickle its results
and load it the next time it is called.

Example of usage
===================================

With the following code, the first time long_function() will be called, it will execute and
save the pickle processed_data. Next time it is run, it will load the pickled object without
running the function.

.. code-block:: python

    from pickler2 import pickled

    @pickled("some_file_name.pck")
    def long_function():
        ... long time to process data ...
        return processed_data

To explicitly re-run the function, you can call

.. code-block:: python

    long_function(run=True)

When using this functionality at different places, within a project, you might want to save
all the pickles at a same place. This can be done by given full name to the decorator

.. code-block:: python

    @pickled("/some/long/path/some_file_name.pck")
    def long_function():
        ... long time to process data ...
        return processed_data

Alternatively, the project pickling path can be registered as follow

.. code-block:: python

    from pickler2 import register_project_path

    register_project_path("/some/long/path/", "my_project")

and then use provide the project name to the constructor:

.. code-block:: python

    @pickled("some_file_name.pck", project_name="my_project")
    def long_function():
        ... long time to process data ...
        return processed_data

The registered pickled path are saved in "~/.pickler_conf.yaml". This allow to run the same code
on different systems with differents path, as long as the corresponding path have been registered
in their respective configuration path.


Why the 2 in Piclker2?
===================================
Because Pickler was already taken on PyPi!
